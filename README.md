  <h1>Talks - online chat app</h1>
  <p>
    Talks is basic chat application connecting you with other enqueued person online. I've chosen React Js as a framework to use together with Material UI for  majority of style.

  <p>
    The app is published on heroku, you can find and try it out on this link -> <a href="http://my-talks.herokuapp.com/" target="blank">my-talks.herokuapp.com</a>.

  <h1>Communication</h1>
  <p>
    I'm using socket.IO for the communication between clients and the server. <a href="https://github.com/davidvajda/talks">Server repo</a>

    After joining a chat (as talkee/listener) you are either connected with opposite role or enqueued in case there's no one in the queue's front.
